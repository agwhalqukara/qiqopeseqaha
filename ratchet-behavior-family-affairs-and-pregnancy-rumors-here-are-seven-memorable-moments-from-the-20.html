The iconic award show was jam-packed with moments that will be remembered forever.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the top seven memorable moments from the night.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-megan-thee-stallion-vs-justin-timberlake><strong>Megan Thee Stallion Vs. Justin Timberlake&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Behind-the-scenes footage from the VMAs captured <a href=#>Megan Thee Stallion</a> waving her fingers at <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a> and appearing to have words with the pop legend. In the video, which has been circulating online, Timberlake has a straight face, which sparked the assumption the two artists had some sort of unkind interaction.</p><p>However, everything is not what it seems. According to a source close to the situation, no altercation between the two took place. In fact, the interaction was the exact opposite.</p><p>“Meg loves Justin,” the source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ET </a>Online. “She was saying, ‘No, no, no, we’ve never met before.’ It was their first time meeting, and she was excited.”</p><p>The “Bongos” rapper later took to social media with a fun-filled video featuring the “SexyBack” vocalist to also clear up any false rumors about a possible argument.</p><p>“I just talk with my hands lol @justintimberlake love ya,” Megan wrote in a post on Instagram.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Megan Thee Stallion (@theestallion)</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-halle-bailey-and-yung-miami-ignite-pregnancy-rumors><strong>Halle Bailey and Yung Miami Ignite Pregnancy Rumors</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Amongst the dazzling pink carpeted looks, two other celebs managed to be the talk of the town due to their chosen ensembles. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Halle Bailey</a> rocked a gorgeous orange halter gown which loosely fell over her stomach. She paired the bright-colored dress with gold accessories and a black handbag, which can be seen covering her stomach in a now-viral video.&nbsp;</p><p>Many social media investigators suggested that the oversized outfit and bag placement were used to hide her seemingly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">poking belly</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The allegations are whooping Halle’s ass 🫠<br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/1GyeDT4Osw</a></p>— Putty™️ (@QuanTurrell) <a href=#>September 13, 2023</a></figure><p>As for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yung Miami</a>, whose real name is Caresha Brownlee, she rocked a black bodysuit with a bikini-style bottom in the front and long and flowy floor-length sleeves. The City Girl rapper sparked conversation after a few fans thought that her fashionable outfit revealed a baby bump.&nbsp;</p><p>While “The Little Mermaid” actress has remained mum concerning any pregnancy rumors, Yung Miami leaned into them, even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">retweeting</a> a post on X that asked, “Is Caresha pregnant?”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-saweetie-claps-back-at-teleprompter-jokes><strong>Saweetie Claps Back at Teleprompter Jokes&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It looks like the self-proclaimed Icy Girl had a difficult time during her debut as an MTV VMAs red carpet correspondent. In several viral videos, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Saweetie</a> can be seen struggling to read the teleprompter while stumbling over her words and at times missing her cue to speak.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>saweetie could not read that teleprompter i'm crying😭 <a href=#>#VMAs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NPb1wytFlR</a></p>— 𝗱𝗮𝗻𝗻𝘆🫧💚 (@beyoncegarden) <a href=#>September 12, 2023</a></figure><p>Social media had a field day with the videos of Saweetie fumbling over her words and after an outfit change, the “My Type” rapper came back on stage where she addressed the online chatter.</p><p>“What’s up, y’all, it’s me again,” she said. “And y’all better stop making my lil’ stutter video go viral. I see what you doing. Anyways, let’s try it again.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=und dir=ltr>.<a href=#>@Saweetie</a> 🤣😂😭😭😭 <a href=#>#VMAs</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7BvhgTrG5f</a></p>— Mela Yela (@_melayela_) <a href=#>September 13, 2023</a></figure><p>By the time Saweetie called out the jokesters about the slip-up, her stutter video had already done numbers online.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-a-list-performance-in-honor-of-hip-hop-s-50th-anniversary><strong>The A-list Performance In Honor of Hip-Hop’s 50th Anniversary</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Several celebrities rocked the stage with their jaw-dropping performances, but the final performance is what maybe engraved in fans’ memories.</p><p>The popular music awards show dedicated its last performance slot&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">to hip-hop legends</a>&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lil Wayne</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">LL Cool J</a>, Grandmaster Flash, Doug E.

The living legends took audience members on a trip through hip-hop history as they performed a medley of songs that&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shaped the culture</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The explosive performance featured snippets from iconic songs such as “The Message,” “Mama Said Knock You Out,” “Itty Bitty Piggy,” “The Show (Oh, My God!)” and more.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-diddy-made-his-vmas-segment-a-family-affair><strong>Diddy Made His VMAs Segment a Family Affair</strong></h2><p>Sean “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Diddy</a>” Combs gave fans feelings of nostalgia as he took over the stage and performed several of his iconic hits such as “Bad Boy for Life,” “I’ll Be Missing You,” and “I Need A Girl” in front of an amped-up crowd.&nbsp;</p><p>During his blazing performance, the Love Records founder brought out his son Christian “King” Combs, as well as his twin daughters, D’Lila and Jessie, his “Shawty Wop” Yung Miami, and singer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Keyshia Cole</a>. The last time fans saw Diddy on the VMAs stage was in 2005 when he hosted the award show.&nbsp;</p><p>Following his set, Diddy was presented with the respected Global Icon Award. He was handed the statue by his eldest daughter, Chance Combs, who accompanied <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary J. Blige </a>onstage to present the music mogul with the award.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>The Bad Boy Records CEO made sure Chance, Christian, D’Lia, and Jessie were right by his side as he accepted the accolade. His two older sons, Quincy Brown and Justin Combs, were spotted cheering for their father from the crowd.&nbsp;</p><p>Diddy also has an almost 1-year-old daughter, Love Sean Combs, with a woman named Dana Tran.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-selena-gomez-reacts-to-chris-brown-being-nominated-for-a-vma><strong>Selena Gomez Reacts to Chris Brown Being Nominated for a VMA</strong></h2><p>It appeared as if <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Selena Gomez</a> was not a big <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Brown</a> fan. Recent video footage from the show showed the “Calm Down” singer scrunching up her face when Brown’s name was mentioned as one of the nominees for “Best R&B” song.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Selena Gomez reacting to Chris Brown being nominated at the <a href=#>#VMAs</a>. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ngx4Ep8aD5</a></p>— Pop Base (@PopBase) <a href=#>September 13, 2023</a></figure><p>Though the “Under The Influence” crooner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately lost</a> to SZA’s song “Shirt,” many fans wondered why Gomez made such a disgusted look after hearing his name.&nbsp;</p><p>While neither celebrity has publicly addressed the video, Brown wrote “Let me mind my business” in an InstagramStory.&nbsp;</p><p>One hour later, Gomez uploaded a message that read, “I will never be a meme again.

Many social media users agreed with Sukihana, suggesting that who she is was the reason why she was backstage and not spotted on the ceremony’s official pink carpet.&nbsp;</p><p>Though these aren’t the only events that occurred on Tuesday night, these viral moments have taken over nearly every virtual conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>READ MORE <a href=#>AT ATLANTA BLACK STAR</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49yZmprX6iyt7HNZqSoq6Riuqa5zquYm6SVYrqwucSnq6xlkal6tbTEZmlpamNiurXCjK%2BkmqtdorKorc1mq6GdlWLAta3LpaCopl8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fratchet-behavior-family-affairs-and-pregnancy-rumors-here-are-seven-memorable-moments-from-the-20.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fratchet-behavior-family-affairs-and-pregnancy-rumors-here-are-seven-memorable-moments-from-the-20.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fratchet-behavior-family-affairs-and-pregnancy-rumors-here-are-seven-memorable-moments-from-the-20.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fratchet-behavior-family-affairs-and-pregnancy-rumors-here-are-seven-memorable-moments-from-the-20.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fratchet-behavior-family-affairs-and-pregnancy-rumors-here-are-seven-memorable-moments-from-the-20.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fratchet-behavior-family-affairs-and-pregnancy-rumors-here-are-seven-memorable-moments-from-the-20.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./the-tragic-life-of-family-feud-host-ray-combs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./the-tragic-life-of-family-feud-host-ray-combs.html>The Tragic Life Of 'Family Feud' Host Ray Combs</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./patricia-barry-net-worth-phone-number-house-address-wiki.html>Patricia Barry Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./patricia-barry-net-worth-phone-number-house-address-wiki.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
