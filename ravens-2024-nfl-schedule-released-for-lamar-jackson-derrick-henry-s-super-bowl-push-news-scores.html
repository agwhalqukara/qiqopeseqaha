However, Baltimore fell short of its ultimate goal of making it to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Jackson and company had their season come to an end in a 17-10 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in a gritty AFC Championship Game, leaving them with a sour taste to chew on throughout the offseason. The team will certainly be motivated to get over the hump and return to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2012.</p><p>Fortunately for Jackson, help is on the way in the form of one of the best running backs in the NFL. Baltimore made a major splash by <a href=# rel=noopener>signing</a> Derrick Henry to a two-year deal worth $16 million. The four-time Pro Bowler and two-time rushing leader is trying to achieve his first career Super Bowl appearance, so it can be expected that he's in for a big year.</p><p>Here's a look at the slate the Ravens will be facing in 2024 as they try to remain in contention for a championship.</p><p><b>2024 Baltimore Ravens Schedule</b></p>Baltimore Ravens <span class=acct>@Ravens</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our 2024 schedule❗&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SeatGeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SeatGeek&lt;/a> | 📺: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nflnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nflnetwork&lt;/a> &lt;br>🎟: &lt;a href="https://t.co/AZEELIRcxm">https://t.co/AZEELIRcxm&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/rBzCNlnOfP">pic.twitter.com/rBzCNlnOfP&lt;/a></p>Baltimore Ravens <span class=acct>@Ravens</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>There was only one man Harbs trusted for the job… &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stavvybaby?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stavvybaby&lt;/a>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SeatGeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SeatGeek&lt;/a> | 📺: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nflnetwork?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nflnetwork&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/3a9OfunYK0">pic.twitter.com/3a9OfunYK0&lt;/a></p><p>Having a tough schedule comes with the territory of finishing with the NFL's best record, but even the Ravens couldn't predict this.</p><p>Baltimore will have the <a href=# rel=noopener>second-hardest</a> strength of schedule in the league next season based on their opponents' 2023 winning percentage. Five division champions and a total of eight playoff teams from last year will be on the docket for the Ravens in 2024. They also play in the toughest division in the league, as every team in the AFC North finished with a winning record last season.</p><p>To make matters worse, Baltimore will be relying on a slew of new faces next season. The Ravens lost <a href=# rel=noopener>15 players</a> over the offseason, the most of any team in the AFC. That list includes Pro Bowl inside linebacker Patrick Queen; three starting offensive linemen in guards Kevin Zeitler and John Simpson and tackle Morgan Moses; their most productive edge rusher in Jadeveon Clowney; their touchdown leader in running back Gus Edwards; and the NFL's runner-up in interceptions last season in safety Geno Stone.</p><p>It wasn't all bad for the Ravens this offseason. The arrival of Henry should take significant pressure off Jackson and further improve an already dangerous Baltimore run game.</p><p>The Ravens also managed to retain one of their most coveted players, as defensive tackle Justin Madubuike was <a href=# rel=noopener>signed</a> to a four-year, $98 million extension after receiving the franchise tag. The deal included $75.5 million in guarantees with $53.5 million at signing, setting records for defensive tackles. Madubuike set a career-high with a team-leading 13 sacks in 2023. Edge rusher Kyle Van Noy was also <a href=# rel=noopener>re-signed</a> following the <a href=# rel=noopener>departure</a> of Clowney.</p><p>Despite the immense roster turnover heading into this season, Baltimore likely remains confident in its chances of making noise once again. The Ravens have a proven track record of being successful at building through the draft, and they made another strong move by adding Clemson cornerback Nate Wiggins with the No. 30 pick in this year's draft in April.</p><p>Baltimore is certainly hoping that head coach John Harbaugh will continue to put his players in positions to excel, as the Ravens will need to be a sound unit on both sides of the ball if they want to successfully make it through a difficult 2024 campaign and reach the Super Bowl.</p><p><b>Pivotal Matchups</b></p><p>The biggest game on the Ravens' schedule and one of the biggest games of the year will come in Week 1 in a rematch against the Chiefs, who went on to become back-to-back Super Bowl champions after getting past Baltimore in the AFC title game.</p><p>The usual suspects remain in place for Kansas City, with the offense led by the star duo of quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce while legendary head coach Andy Reid calls the plays. The Chiefs were also able to re-sign their most important free agent in defensive tackle Chris Jones, who finally received the long-term deal he hoped for with a massive <a href=# rel=noopener>five-year contract</a> that includes $95 million guaranteed.</p><p>The Ravens had the benefit of playing in front of their home fans at M&T Bank Stadium in the conference championship. Unfortunately for them, the rematch will take place in the hostile environment of Arrowhead Stadium. The last time Baltimore was victorious in Kansas City was <a href=# rel=noopener>in 2012</a>.</p><p>The Chiefs game isn't the only matchup on the Ravens schedule that is sure to produce fireworks. Facing the AFC East champion Buffalo Bills and AFC South champion Houston Texans will surely provide excitement for NFL fans, regardless of their allegiances.</p><p>Facing the Texans, in particular, brings a high level of intrigue after the team's banner offseason. Houston is considered to be an attractive pick to win the AFC after adding talented veterans Stefon Diggs and Joe Mixon to an offense that is led by reigning Offensive Rookie of the Year C.J. Stroud. Star edge rusher Danielle Hunter was also brought in to pair on the opposite side of reigning Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr.</p><p>A pair of NFC East matchups will also be fun to watch, as the division-champion Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles will present challenges for the Ravens.</p><p>Baltimore has to deal with those teams while also going through the gauntlet of the AFC North. The Pittsburgh Steelers will look different with veteran quarterback Russell Wilson under center. The Cleveland Browns and Cincinnati Bengals have reloaded with the impending returns of quarterbacks Deshaun Watson and Joe Burrow, respectively.</p><p>All of this creates a massive storm that the Ravens will have to navigate through as they try to contend for a spot in Super Bowl 59.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWx%2FeYCMq5ivnZ6oenN8kW1kp56cYsCktMSdrKWdXaeyrbHArJydZZakv264wKaYq2WalrCsv86nZJ2doqe2pLeMoZynqqmoerTBz56pZpqfrLluvNSsnw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fravens-2024-nfl-schedule-released-for-lamar-jackson-derrick-henry-s-super-bowl-push-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fravens-2024-nfl-schedule-released-for-lamar-jackson-derrick-henry-s-super-bowl-push-news-scores.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fravens-2024-nfl-schedule-released-for-lamar-jackson-derrick-henry-s-super-bowl-push-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fravens-2024-nfl-schedule-released-for-lamar-jackson-derrick-henry-s-super-bowl-push-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fravens-2024-nfl-schedule-released-for-lamar-jackson-derrick-henry-s-super-bowl-push-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fravens-2024-nfl-schedule-released-for-lamar-jackson-derrick-henry-s-super-bowl-push-news-scores.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-aydin-maxwell-the-son-of-fetty-wap-and-ariel-reese.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-aydin-maxwell-the-son-of-fetty-wap-and-ariel-reese.html>Who is Aydin Maxwell, the son of Fetty Wap and Ariel Reese?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./christopher-harvest-s-music-career-ended-before-it-took-off.html>Christopher Harvest's music career ended before it took off</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./christopher-harvest-s-music-career-ended-before-it-took-off.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
