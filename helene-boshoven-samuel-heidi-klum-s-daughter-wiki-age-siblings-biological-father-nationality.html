Helene is just 14 years old, and for now, remains only known as the daughter of Heidi Klum.</p><p>So, do you want to find out more about Helene’s life, from childhood to the most recent days? If yes, then stay with us for a while as we bring you closer to Heidi Klum’s daughter.</p><h2><span id=Helene_Boshoven_Samuel_Wiki_Age_Biological_Father_Childhood>Helene Boshoven Samuel Wiki: Age, Biological Father, Childhood</span></h2><p>Helene was born on the 4th May 2004 in New York, the USA, and is the daughter of Heidi Klum and her ex-partner, Flavio Briatore. Heide and Flavio started dating in March 2003 and in December the same year, Heidi announced that she was pregnant with Helene. However, Heidi’s and Flavio’s relationship couldn’t stand the test of time, and they broke up even before Helene was born. Heidi then started a romantic relationship with the singer Seal, who was present during Helene’s birth, and since then has been a father figure to her, as Heidi and Seal continued their relationship, marrying in December 2004, and staying together until 2012 when they separated. Before that, Heidi and Seal made Helene a step-sister to Henry Günther Ademola Dashtu Samuel, Johan Riley Fyodor Taiwo Samuel, and Lou Sulola Samuel.
