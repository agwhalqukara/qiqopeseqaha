<time>28 Sep 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Children’s mystery movie have always been lavishly redone countless times. Death on the Nile is the most recent addition to the list. This Hercule Poirot deduction lesson revolves around Gal Gadot, Kenneth Branagh, Armie Hammer, and Annette Bening as the main characters.</p><p>In the field of private investigations, the detective is a legendary figure, considered by many to be on par with Sherlock Holmes. Poirot has very little competition among fictional characters in terms of brevity and showmanship.</p><p>Death on the Nile does one better than the most recent Poirot movie by setting the action on a streamer. Once more, Poirot’s holiday ends in murder. The movie is well-made, but due to its inspiration, it lacks any shocks.</p><p>For the most part, the mystery is compelling and gripping. It never gets old to look forward to witnessing the outstanding cast in the intimate environment. Given how excellent and enjoyable it was, we made the decision to compile a list of 10 films that you should see if you like Death on the Nile. Happy reading!</p><p class=toc_title>Table Of Content</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> Bad Times at El Royale (2018)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> Brick (2005)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> Clue (1985)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Gosford Park (2001)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">5</span> Knives Out (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">6</span> Murder on the Orient Express (1974)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">7</span> Mystery Team (2009)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">8</span> Ready or Not (2019)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">9</span> Rope (1948)</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">10</span> The Hateful Eight (2015)</a></li></ul><h3><span id=Bad_Times_at_El_Royale_2018>Bad Times at El Royale (2018)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BAD-TIMES-AT-EL-ROYALE-768x404-1.jpg alt width=768 height=404 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Bad Times at El Royale’s opening act is good enough to stand alone as a short movie. The second half, while only marginally weaker, falls short of the eerie setup. Similar to Death on the Nile, the movie is set in the namesake hotel and has a larger conspiracy that no one anticipates.</p><p>Despite the ensemble receiving equal screen time, Dakota Johnson serves as the group’s strong leader. The cinematography becomes the main draw thanks to the gliding camera. On this list, it is debatably the best. Not to discount other factors, but this greatly improves the quality. Bad Times at the El Royale is ruthlessly aggressive in trying to establish itself in a new market. The foundation is beautiful and interesting. There won’t be a dull time for you here!</p><h3><span id=Brick_2005>Brick (2005)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BRICK-768x432-1.jpg alt width=768 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The whole filmography of Rian Johnson might be included here or could be listed separately. The elite have hailed him as an inspiration because of how his movies have affected the genre in contemporary culture.</p><p>In Brick, popular themes like youthful romance, whodunit, and revealing a city’s seedy side are all combined into one engrossing story. The success of Brick depends on how detailed it can make the inevitable, much like Death on the Nile. Johnson makes excellent use of his big cast to continually mislead spectators.</p><p>Every time you think you’ve figured out the code, a stubborn Johnson throws you for a loop. A wonderful leading man, Gordon Levitt is. His persona acts as the ideal waypoint for the audience to explore Brick’s harsh and uncaring environment.</p><h3><span id=Clue_1985>Clue (1985)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CLUE.jpg alt width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Clue is the entry on the list with the best comedy out of all the others. In terms of gravity and humour, its narration is the lightest. Without too much plot, Clue cleverly delivers you hints along the way to make sense of what is going on.</p><p>Clue and Death on the Nile both share a passi on for the idea of a diverse and competitive bunch of strangers investigating a murder case while simultaneously defending their own reputations.</p><p>Because of its creative execution and genuinely theatrical characters, this has developed a cult following. You can’t help but feel the same way since Clue is so forthright about its intentions to be completely irreverent about itself and does so with such a strong feeling of self-assurance.</p><h3><span id=Gosford_Park_2001>Gosford Park (2001)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GOSFORD-PARK-768x499-1.jpg alt width=768 height=499 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Few filmmakers have Robert Altman’s talent for controlling large casts in a tight space. Long, attentive shots that expose us to his universe and a prose-like backdrop to the current impulses are frequently the foundation of his detailed descriptive technique.</p><p>Such methods are not used very frequently in today’s mainstream cinema. Another justification for keeping this masterpiece in mind. Gosford Park is included on the list because it shares all of the same plot points as Death on the Nile. Despite the resemblance, Altman’s mastery of his art ensures that the movie leaves you with a personal and unsettling impression.</p><h3><span id=Knives_Out_2019>Knives Out (2019)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/KNIVES-OUT.jpg alt width=677 height=381 sizes="(max-width: 677px) 100vw, 677px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Knives Out is one of those murder mysteries that presents a novel angle on the genre. In the first few minutes of the movie, not only is the crime admitted, but the criminal is also identified.</p><p>In her role as the main antagonist who commits the crime, Ana de Armas does a fantastic job at dressing the part. Knives Out taps into well-worn themes of broken families and rivalries that breed an unquenchable desire for everything.</p><p>Similar to Death on the Nile, Knives Out is mostly set in a single location, depicts a murder in which all relevant parties are suspects, and employs a brilliant investigator who is up for the task.</p><h3><span id=Murder_on_the_Orient_Express_1974>Murder on the Orient Express (1974)<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MURDER-ON-THE-ORIENT-EXPRESS-768x512-1.jpg alt width=768 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></span></h3><p>Here, the decision was between two excellent movies about the same topic. The two movies have a few minor storyline variations, but we’ve chosen to stick with the original. Just to be clear, Albert Finney was the deciding element in this case.</p><p>Murder on the Orient Express centres around a murder that happens on a train called the Orient Express, as the title would imply. There is barely a dull moment throughout the entire setup of this classic whodunnit because it keeps the mystery moving so brilliantly. It is similar to Death on the Nile because of the single location and the fact that it is a Poirot adventure.</p><h3><span id=Mystery_Team_2009>Mystery Team (2009)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MYSTERY-TEAM-768x432-1.jpg alt width=768 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There has never been a case where high school charm worked. It affects us all in precisely the same ways, to such unfathomable degrees that you’d believe it included rocket science. What was intended to be a quick comedic sketch has been expanded by the film’s creative team into a full-length feature. A difficult sell, but one that is well worth the effort given how much fun the characters and plot are.</p><p>Its meta component is essential to the joke’s humour. Although the execution is so compelling that it is difficult to give up on them, the basic plot is derivative and loses interest. When you think it could veer off into a coming-of-age tangent, it really does the exact opposite and still involves the viewer in a phoney transformation.</p><p>The setting of Mystery Team appears to be stuck in the present. The comic troupe Derrick is a little careless with the old-fashioned and outmoded framework of its plot. But it’s entertaining and funny, and it’ll be a terrific addition to the watchlist.</p><h3><span id=Ready_or_Not_2019>Ready or Not (2019)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/READY-OR-NOT-768x512-1.jpg alt width=768 height=512 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Themes from the past that have seen numerous versions are combined in a novel way in Ready or Not. The storyline is so compelling that it cannot be ignored, even though the final explanation is, to put it mildly, lame.</p><p>Samara Weaving is a strong lead who adapts to the story’s shifting dynamics with ease. She develops a wonderful character sketch with skillful direction that is reminiscent of the strong feminist connotations seen in earlier movies. The tasteful brutality gives the whole visual appeal a seductive style. Ready or Not is for you if you like Death on the Nile but desired a more dramatic story with a more relatable protagonist.</p><h3><span id=Rope_1948>Rope (1948)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ROPE-768x432-1.jpg alt width=768 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Without mentioning Alfred Hitchcock, a list of murder mysteries would be laughable. In the illustrious history of Hollywood’s motion pictures, the genre’s original inventor always employed straightforward, efficient techniques. The premise of Rope follows convention. But what distinguishes it from the other entries on the list is the level of detail and integration of the characters’ intelligence.</p><p>Murder and a singular setting are two commonalities. In addition, Rope develops into an engaging investigation on the misleading nature of human existence. The quaint feeling of restraint and reverence is well-versed in Hitchcock’s abstractness. He creates a powerful screenplay that is both explosive and delicate within those boundaries.</p><h3><span id=The_Hateful_Eight_2015>The Hateful Eight (2015)</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/HATEFUL-EIGHT-768x432-1.jpg alt width=768 height=432 sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A true master of his profession, Quentin Tarantino. His brilliant methods for developing enduring characters and cultural icons are almost unsurpassed. By his standards, The Hateful Eight is likely the quietest.</p><p>It is more of a gradual burn, methodically constructed, and barely runs ragged, in contrast to his natural approach. All of Tarantino’s prior movies have erred on the side of character and plot development.</p><p>Although the explanation begins at the very end of the non-linear chain of events in The Hateful Eight, A thorough examination of human nature, justice principles, and the corruption of civilisation is made possible by the vivid inhabitants of his cosmos contained in a single space.</p><p>If all of this was too much, consideration is still given to an ongoing, dynamic murder mystery.</p><p>Here are our top 10 movie recommendations to keep you occupied after seeing Death on the Nile!</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/icon-256x256-1-150x150.png alt itemprop=image sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>Divesh Solanki</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Being a binge-watcher himself, finding Content to write about comes naturally to Divesh.
