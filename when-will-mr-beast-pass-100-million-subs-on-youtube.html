<time>08 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The nearly unprecedented rise of <a href=#>YouTube star <strong>MrBeast</strong></a> has drawn speculation over when he will reach 100 million subscribers on his main channel. Only a handful of channels have surpassed the 100 million mark but MrBeast is soon to become one of them. With his videos increasing in popularity&nbsp;over time, here’s when MrBeast is expected to reach the YouTube milestone.</p><p>MrBeast’s main channel was relatively unknown, sitting at around 30,000 until a video of him counting to 100,000 went viral in 2017. Since then, he has grown in popularity by filming high production videos and focusing on shock factor. Some of his most viewed videos involved him spending 50 hours buried alive or surviving for 24 hours on a desert island. In November 2021 he even went as far as recreating the&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix TV show Squid Game</a>, which saw him gain millions of new followers in just a few days. These feats are even more impressive considering the fact that MrBeast runs five other channels alongside his main, including MrBeast Gaming and MrBeast Reacts,&nbsp;while also starting up his delivery-based fast-food chain MrBeast Burger.</p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>MrBeast Video Totally Misses The Point of Squid Game</a></span></p><p>To predict when MrBeast will hit the 100 million subscriber count, the dates of his past achievements must be taken into account. After his first viral video in 2016, he continued to upload. By November 2017, he had reached his first million subscribers. Towards the end of 2018, he was seeing monthly views upwards of 100 million, and finally, on January 4th, 2021, he hit the 50 million mark. In November 2021, <a href=#>MrBeast’s recreation of Squid Game</a> broke Netflix’s viewing records with 100 million views in four days, and his channel benefitted from over 9.2 million subscribers in a month. The growth of his channel has been rapid, and as of February 2022, he is gaining approximately 73,000 subscribers per day (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Blade</a>). With this in mind, if his subscriber count continues to increase at this rate, he should reach 100 million subscribers around June 25th, 2022.</p><figure class=item-img></figure><p>This estimation assumes the growth of his channel will remain consistent, but there is a chance he could beat that date if he produces another viral video, such as his Squid Game recreation. On Logan Paul’s podcast Impaulsive, MrBeast also outlined the strategies he is using to boost his growth. He stated that a large portion of the profit from each video is reinvested into future projects and <a href=#>explained to Vine-turned-YouTube star Logan Paul</a> that he is committed to producing good quality uploads, scrapping previous videos if he didn’t believe they were up to scratch. Alongside this, he has started dubbing his most popular videos in different languages to reach a wider audience.</p><p>These factors combined will undoubtedly accelerate the growth of his channel. MrBeast’s achievements so far have been staggering considering the length of time he has been active on YouTube, and he is well on his way to being one of the most viewed channels on the platform. With all signs pointing to him reaching 100 million subscribers by late June, if not sooner, 2022 looks to be another very successful year for <strong>MrBeast</strong>. Either way, it will be a momentous occasion for YouTube when another of its creators reaches the highly coveted 100 million subscriber milestone.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who Won Mr Beast’s Squid Game (& What Was The Prize Money?)</a>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><span class=next-btn-text-title>90 Day Fiancé: Ximena Debuts Shocking Hair Transformation After Mike Split</span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8inq56qpp6yuL%2BOsJ%2Bepl2stq24jKapZpqVlsC1ec%2BaqqxlYWV9brnIpaOip55iwLau0mamp2WppMK1wcGeZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhen-will-mr-beast-pass-100-million-subs-on-youtube.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhen-will-mr-beast-pass-100-million-subs-on-youtube.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhen-will-mr-beast-pass-100-million-subs-on-youtube.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhen-will-mr-beast-pass-100-million-subs-on-youtube.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhen-will-mr-beast-pass-100-million-subs-on-youtube.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhen-will-mr-beast-pass-100-million-subs-on-youtube.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./45-hard-questions-to-ask-your-boyfriend-when-getting-serious-in-a-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./45-hard-questions-to-ask-your-boyfriend-when-getting-serious-in-a-relationship.html>45 Hard Questions To Ask Your Boyfriend When Getting Serious In A Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./razer-edge-gaming-tablet-is-windows-8-laptop-console-and-steam-box-in-one.html>Razer Edge gaming tablet is Windows 8 laptop, console and 'Steam Box' in one</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./razer-edge-gaming-tablet-is-windows-8-laptop-console-and-steam-box-in-one.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
