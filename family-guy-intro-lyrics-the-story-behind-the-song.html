<time>06 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Family Guy is one of the most popular animated sitcoms in the world, created by Seth MacFarlane for Fox in 1999. The show follows the adventures of the Griffin family, a dysfunctional clan living in the fictional town of Quahog, Rhode Island. The show is known for its irreverent humor, pop culture references, and musical numbers.</p><p>One of the most iconic features of Family Guy is its opening theme song, which introduces the main characters and sets the tone for the show. The song is a parody of the classic sitcom All in the Family, which aired from 1971 to 1979 and starred Carroll O’Connor and Jean Stapleton as Archie and Edith Bunker, a conservative couple living in Queens, New York.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Origin of the Song</h2><p>According to Seth MacFarlane, the creator of Family Guy, he was inspired by the opening theme of All in the Family, which featured Archie and Edith singing at a piano about their views on life and society. MacFarlane wanted to create a similar song for Family Guy, but with a modern twist and a more upbeat tempo.</p><p>MacFarlane wrote the lyrics for the song, which poke fun at various aspects of American culture, such as violence, sex, politics, and religion. He also composed the music for the song, which is influenced by Broadway musicals and jazz standards. MacFarlane himself performs the voice of Peter Griffin, the patriarch of the family, who sings the song with his wife Lois, voiced by Alex Borstein.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Lyrics of the Song</h2><p>The song begins with Peter and Lois sitting at a piano in their living room, while their children Meg, Chris, and Stewie watch from the couch. The lyrics are as follows:</p><p><strong>Peter:</strong> It seems today that all you see</p><p>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</p><p><strong>Lois:</strong> But where are those good old-fashioned values</p><p>On which we used to rely?</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Lucky there’s a family guy</p><p>Lucky there’s a man who positively can do</p><p>All the things that make us</p><p><strong>Stewie:</strong> Laugh and cry!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> He’s a family guy!</p><p>The song then transitions to a montage of scenes featuring various characters from the show, such as Brian the dog, Quagmire the neighbor, Joe the cop, Cleveland the friend, and Herbert the old man. The lyrics continue:</p><p><strong>Peter:</strong> When I was young, the songs were fair</p><p>With Mr. Rogers and Captain Kangaroo</p><p><strong>Lois:</strong> But now the only songs you hear</p><p>Are by Britney Spears and Marilyn Manson</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Lucky there’s a family guy</p><p>Lucky there’s a fella who can tell a joke or two</p><p>He’s got a lot of attitude</p><p><strong>Stewie:</strong> He’s not very shrewd!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> He’s a family guy!</p><p>The song ends with Peter and Lois returning to the piano and singing the final chorus:</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> Lucky there’s a family guy</p><p>Lucky there’s a man who positively can do</p><p>All the things that make us</p><p><strong>Stewie:</strong> Laugh and cry!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong> He’s our family guy!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Meaning of the Song</h2><p>The song is meant to be a satire of the American society and culture, as well as a tribute to the classic sitcoms of the past. The song contrasts the values and entertainment of the previous generations with those of the present day, highlighting how much things have changed over time. The song also reflects the personality and humor of Peter Griffin, who is often oblivious, insensitive, and politically incorrect.</p><p>The song also serves as an introduction to the show and its characters, giving a glimpse of their lives and relationships. The song showcases the main themes and elements of Family Guy, such as comedy, parody, musicality, and absurdity.</p><p>The song is also catchy and memorable, making it one of the most recognizable theme songs in television history. The song has become a part of pop culture itself, being referenced and parodied by other shows, movies, and celebrities.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Conclusion</h2><p>Family Guy Intro Lyrics is more than just a song; it is a statement of what Family Guy is all about. It is a clever and witty way of expressing the vision and voice of Seth MacFarlane and his creation. It is also a fun and enjoyable way of entertaining and engaging the audience. It is one of the reasons why Family Guy is such a successful and beloved show.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibkaeypr7GnpirZpiau7CyjZympmeemsS0e9KtpquxX5uurrXLsmSgralitq%2FA0ahkpbGinrC0edOhnGarpKS%2FunnBnp%2BippRiwamxjKymp59f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffamily-guy-intro-lyrics-the-story-behind-the-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffamily-guy-intro-lyrics-the-story-behind-the-song.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffamily-guy-intro-lyrics-the-story-behind-the-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffamily-guy-intro-lyrics-the-story-behind-the-song.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffamily-guy-intro-lyrics-the-story-behind-the-song.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffamily-guy-intro-lyrics-the-story-behind-the-song.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jarryd-hayne-trolled-online-after-being-found-guilty-of-sexually-assaulting-woman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jarryd-hayne-trolled-online-after-being-found-guilty-of-sexually-assaulting-woman.html>Jarryd Hayne trolled online after being found guilty of sexually assaulting woman</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./demi-moore-continues-to-spark-plastic-surgery-rumors-after-sharing-new-photos.html>Demi Moore Continues To Spark Plastic Surgery Rumors After Sharing New Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./demi-moore-continues-to-spark-plastic-surgery-rumors-after-sharing-new-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
