In 1989, he and his business partner Bertram Lee were the first African-Americans to buy a controlling interest in a National Basketball Association (NBA) team, when they purchased a 37.5% share of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, and he is among the most influential minority figures in sports law and management.</p><p>Bynoe attended William Lloyd Garrison Elementary School, and graduated from Boston Latin School in 1968. He credited his parents with instilling high standards and expecting him to achieve in school. He also had a love of sports, growing up as a regular Boston Celtics and Boston Red Sox fan; but although both teams had black players, racial relations in Boston at that time were still tense, and black fans like Bynoe were hesitant to attend the games.</p><p align=justify>Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Bynoe came from a well-respected family. His father Victor C. Bynoe, had emigrated from his native Barbados at age 13, and after graduating from Northeastern University with degrees in Civil Engineering and Law, became a successful attorney. (At one point, he represented Boston Celtics star Bill Russell.) At a time when few blacks were being promoted to important positions in government, Victor Bynoe was named to Boston Mayor John B. Hynes’ cabinet in 1950, serving on the Street Commission. He later became commissioner of Veterans’ Services in Boston, and served on the board of the Boston Housing Authority. Peter’s mother Ethel was American; she was praised by the black newspapers for her community involvement and volunteerism. Peter also had an uncle John Bynoe, who was active in the fight for civil rights, serving as the regional civil rights director for the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare.</p><h2>Peter Bynoe Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Peter is one of the <strong>richest Lawyer</strong> from United States.

From January 1988 to June 1992, Bynoe served as the Executive Director of the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, a joint venture of the City of Chicago and State of Illinois, which gave him complete supervisory, planning and executing responsibility for the $250 million construction of New Comiskey Park for the Chicago White Sox, which was completed as scheduled and well within its budget. He also became known in Chicago for his business relationships with such influential sports stars as Michael Jordan, a former client with whom he remained friends.</p><p>In late November 1987, he married Linda Jean Walker, who was then vice-president of the fixed-income division of Morgan Stanley in New York.</p><h2>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h2><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Peter Bynoe ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Lee and Bynoe had worked together in Boston years earlier, and Bynoe thought of Lee as a mentor. They had kept in touch, and were involved in several real estate dealings together. But the Nuggets deal was problematic from the start. In fact, it almost fell through because Lee did not have the resources everyone, Bynoe among them, thought he had. Media reports depicted Lee as a wealthy and successful businessman who was a financier with offices in two cities, and formerly part owner of Boston’s WNEV-TV. But Lee and Bynoe were unable to meet the deadline to purchase the team from then-owner Sidney Shlenker. It would later be revealed that Lee had problems raising the needed capital. It was Bynoe, with the assistance of David Stern, Jay Pritzker, and Jerrold Wexler, who salvaged the transaction over the course of six months. The mainstream media reported that Lee and Bynoe were now the first two blacks to own a major sports team, but several of the black newspapers pointed out that the two men were actually managing general partners rather than owners, because the revised agreement to purchase the team meant they owned only a 37.5% stake in the team. Bynoe sold his interest in the franchise in August 1992. Communications Satellite Corporation’s (COMSAT) Video Enterprises subsidiary put up 62.5% of the $65 million needed to purchase the Nuggets.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Peter Bynoe height</b> Not available right now.
