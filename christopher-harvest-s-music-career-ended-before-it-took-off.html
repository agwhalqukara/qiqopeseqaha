His zodiac sign is Sagittarius.</p><h3>Christopher Harvest's nationality</h3><p class=align-left>Actress Vivica A. Fox's ex-husband is an American citizen. He was born and raised in the United States.</p><h3>Christopher Harvest and Vivica A. Fox's marriage</h3><p class=align-left>Harvest met Vivica in December 1996, and they started dating soon after. Chris moved into Vivica's house four months later and proposed to her with a <a href=#>platinum ring</a> in December 1997.</p><p class=align-left>The couple married at a ceremony held at the Park Plaza in Los Angeles, California, in December 1998. Several celebrities, including Madame King, Shaq O'Neal, Tisha Campbell-Martin, Madame King, and Holly Robinson Peete, attended the <a href=#>wedding</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e7ea86568d75a0fa.png><h3>Christopher Harvest's divorce</h3><p class=align-left>Harvest's marriage to<a href=#> Vivica A.

The actress later revealed the reason behind their split during an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview with VladTV.</a></p><p class=align-left>Vivica wanted a fairytale wedding due to peer pressure. She ended up rushing her marriage to Chris before getting to know him.</p>I did. I hate to say that. Everyone was having their Cinderella day, and I just wanted one, too, to be very honest with you. Why the marriage didn't last a long time is 'cause I didn't take the time to get to know him. I felt peer pressure.<p class=align-left>She was not happy when Christopher did not pursue his career with passion. The actress did not like being the breadwinner and opted for divorce.</p>You know, a woman doesn't like paying all the bills all the time. I can only ask for help so many times before I had to come to the conclusion that I didn't want to be the breadwinner in this family. My mother didn't raise me to take care of a man. And that was the deciding factor.<h3>Who is Christopher Harvest married to?</h3><p class=align-left>Harvest remarried after his divorce, but his current wife is not known.
