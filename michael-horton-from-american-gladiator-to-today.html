<time>15 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>The popular <a href=#>reality show</a> “American Gladiators” is the subject of the documentary series “Muscles & Mayhem: An Unauthorised Story of American Gladiators” on <a href=#>Netflix</a>. The latter had its 1989 debut and ran for seven seasons until 1996, with the “Gladiators” who appeared therein growing in stature in the eyes of the American people. Michael “Myke” Horton, better known as Gemini, is one such celebrity. We’ve got your back if you’re one of those people who wonders where he is these days.</p><h3>Who is Michael Horton?</h3><p>Myke made the decision to relocate to California in order to play football at the University of California after growing up in Yakima, Washington. He was even selected by the New England Patriots in the NFL draughts as a result of his outstanding performance. He was forced to leave the game, nevertheless, because of an injury in his Achilles tendon. He then tried to get into the entertainment business and made brief appearances on programmes including “Card Sharks” and “Press Your Luck.”</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/M3-1.jpg alt="michael horton,michael horton actor,michael horton theologian,michael horton days of our lives,michael horton gemini,michael horton obituary,debbie zipp and michael horton,michael horton and debbie zipp,dr michael horton,michael s horton,michael horton nz,michael horton nfl,michael horton kc,who played michael horton on days of our lives,april and michael horton,st michael&amp;#039;s horton,michael m. horton,michael g horton pa" width=500 height=330 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Myke wasn’t asked to join a new show named “American Gladiators” for which the pilot hadn’t yet been shot for very long. Five other pros had to go up against other competitors in addition to him. Given the multiple problems that arose while filming the show’s pilot, the creators decided to completely redesign the 13-episode run after giving it a chance to film its first episode. However, only Myke remained a part of the show moving forward out of the six “original gladiators” who appeared in the pilot, which led to the development of Gemini.</p><p>Myke assumed certain leadership responsibilities when it came to recruiting new gladiators because of his long-standing affiliation with the programme. He also selected some of the program’s most recognisable players to participate in the initiative. Mike revealed that he suffered numerous injuries throughout the years, and that the working circumstances were far from ideal when the show first began. While certain things did improve, he continued to have disagreements about other things.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/M2-1.jpg alt="michael horton,michael horton actor,michael horton theologian,michael horton days of our lives,michael horton gemini,michael horton obituary,debbie zipp and michael horton,michael horton and debbie zipp,dr michael horton,michael s horton,michael horton nz,michael horton nfl,michael horton kc,who played michael horton on days of our lives,april and michael horton,st michael&amp;#039;s horton,michael m. horton,michael g horton pa" width=500 height=325 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Myke made the decision to take a stand against the show’s production firm, The Samuel Goldwyn firm, after the “American Gladiator” live tour. He reportedly demanded that the business pay him, Danny Lee “Nitro” Clark, Raye “Zap” Hollitt, and Lori “Ice” Fetrick a piece of the earnings from any merchandise that used their likenesses, or they would leave the show. They reveal in the documentary that they were in exchange. ‘American Gladiators’ included Myke from 1989 to 1989, and he was well-liked for his work. He had fans in every home in America thanks to the fame he had earned as a result of his career.</p><h3>Where is Michael Horton Now?</h3><p>Myke is a family man who values time spent with his loved ones as of the time of writing. He spent some time as a bouncer again after his time on the adored reality programme. He later entered the private training industry and rose to fame as a personal trainer. He has also made appearances in other television shows like “Matlock” and “Murder, She Wrote.” Myke does not currently appear to be active on social media, although he is undoubtedly friendly with his fellow gladiators.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/M4-1.jpg alt="michael horton,michael horton actor,michael horton theologian,michael horton days of our lives,michael horton gemini,michael horton obituary,debbie zipp and michael horton,michael horton and debbie zipp,dr michael horton,michael s horton,michael horton nz,michael horton nfl,michael horton kc,who played michael horton on days of our lives,april and michael horton,st michael&amp;#039;s horton,michael m. horton,michael g horton pa" width=500 height=293 sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>It is clear from what he has said in the Netflix series that he enjoys his role as a parent and grandfather. Wes Horton, who played football for the University of Southern California and later the Carolina Panthers after briefly being associated with the New Orleans Saints, actually followed in his father’s footsteps. On February 4, 2020, he ultimately announced his retirement from the NFL. Similar to Myke, Shane Horton played for both the USC Trojans and the Toronto Argonauts.</p><a class=m-a-box-avatar-url href=#><img width=150 height=150 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/logo-Finale.png alt="michael horton,michael horton actor,michael horton theologian,michael horton days of our lives,michael horton gemini,michael horton obituary,debbie zipp and michael horton,michael horton and debbie zipp,dr michael horton,michael s horton,michael horton nz,michael horton nfl,michael horton kc,who played michael horton on days of our lives,april and michael horton,st michael's horton,michael m. horton,michael g horton pa" itemprop=image style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><h5><a class=m-a-box-name-url href=#>DCS</a></h5><a href=# class=m-a-box-data-toggle><span class=m-a-box-string-more-posts>+ posts</span></a><p>Our Team DCS includes 5 different writers proficient in English and research based Content Writing.
